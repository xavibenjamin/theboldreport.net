> Since The Wirecutter was founded in 2011 and The Sweethome in 2013, we haven’t wavered from our mission to help people effortlessly choose and buy the stuff they need in order to live a better life. Until today, we’ve carried out that mission on two separate sites primarily covering tech and home.

I *love* *The Wirecutter*… well… *Wirecutter* now. It's been the source of many great recommendations for me. For years, it's been the first place I check before making a purchase. I'm happy to see *Wirecutter* evolve and continue with its awesomeness.
