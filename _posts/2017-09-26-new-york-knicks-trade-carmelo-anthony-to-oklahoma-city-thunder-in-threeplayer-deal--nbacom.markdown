From NBA.com:

> The New York Knickerbockers announced today that the team has acquired center Enes Kanter, forward Doug McDermott and Chicago’s 2018 second-round draft pick from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for forward Carmelo Anthony.
>
> “This is a deal we feel works for both this franchise and Carmelo. We thank him for his seven seasons in a Knicks uniform and all that he accomplished off the court for the City of New York by using his platform to address social issues,” President Steve Mills said. “We will continue to focus on this team looking forward towards the immediate and long-term future. As we have said recently, this is a new beginning for the New York Knicks.”

I thought for sure Carmelo Anthony was going to be stuck playing another sucky season for the Knicks, but boy am I glad that's not the case. Carmelo Anthony is a highly underrated player. Phil Jackson took care of that. 

Anthony's play on Team USA tells me he can win with the right people around him though. I believe that's the Thunder. I'd love to see the Thunder beat Golden State and for Carmelo to finally get his moment.
