Federico Viticci on *MacStories*:

> Below, you'll find a collection of my iOS 10 wishes, organized in tentpole features (the ones also shown in the video) plus additional sub-sections. Some of these wishes have been on my list for years; others are a consequence of the features Apple shipped with iOS 9.

Who knows what Apple is working on for iOS 10, but it would be amazing to see some of these wishes make it. Check these out, the video is very well done.
