Jason Fried on *Signal v. Noise*:

> I’m often asked about the benefits we offer at Basecamp. Potential employees are obviously curious, but most of the questions I get are from fellow business owners and entrepreneurs. Everyone’s looking to know what everyone else is doing — as are we — so I figured I might as well post our current benefit list publicly.

What an excellent show of transparency. In a time where it seems that so many companies are out to exploit their employees, it’s refreshing to see a company giving priority to the health and well-being of their own. *This* is how you attract and retain talent.
