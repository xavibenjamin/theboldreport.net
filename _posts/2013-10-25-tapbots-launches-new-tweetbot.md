While I admire all the hard work that went in creating this new version of Tweetbot, I can't help be a little disappointed. The app has lost much of its personality; both visually and sonically. The new app has some very well done animations, but unfortunately looks too "default iOS 7" for my taste.

However, I did purchase because I respect the work of Tapbots very much and I want to support them. They have the reputation of making incredible things, and I look forward to seeing the betterment of Tweetbot.
