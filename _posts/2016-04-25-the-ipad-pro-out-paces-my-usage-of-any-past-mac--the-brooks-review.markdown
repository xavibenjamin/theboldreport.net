Ben Brooks:

> What has actually happened is that my iPad has not only grown in usage, but it has dominated my overall computer usage. So instead of my Mac and iPad flipping places, my iPad has taken a large slice of the pie. My device usage patterns now look more like: 70% iPad, 20% iPhone, and 10% Mac. Thus not only has my usage of the Mac dropped, but so too has my usage of my iPhone.

Fascinating. I don’t think any designer or developer is anywhere near this point; the tools aren’t there yet. But the iPad is becoming more and more powerful, and the average person doesn’t need much more.
