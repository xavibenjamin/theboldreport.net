Ben Brooks:

> You should be confident in what you do, but know that failure can still happen — and failure is not good. That’s how you avoid failure itself — by seeing it as possible, and correcting mistakes which can lead to failure along the way, not the next time around.
>
> What’s not ok is assuming that if you fail, everything is ok and you still get a trophy — sorry, you failed. Some of your employees lost their homes, cars, and have suffered because you failed. So no, you don’t get a trophy, or a feather in your cap, you’re just an ass going around a telling people that you are only more awesome now because you failed.
