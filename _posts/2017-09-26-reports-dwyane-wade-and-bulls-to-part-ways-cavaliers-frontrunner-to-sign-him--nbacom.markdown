Tim Reynolds for *The Associated Press* and NBA.com:

> Wade and the Chicago Bulls agreed to terms on a buyout agreement Sunday, a person with direct knowledge of the talks told *The Associated Press*. Wade is considering several options, including a potential return to Miami or a reunion with longtime friend LeBron James in Cleveland, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the buyout has not been formally announced.

> Wade will have other suitors, as well. ESPN reported San Antonio is a possible landing spot, and Oklahoma City…

This is a prime example of how playing for your hometown is not all it's hyped up to be. Now that Dwyane Wade's stint with the Bulls is over though, I'm excited to where he goes next. 

Cleveland is the obvious first choice, since according to Wade, he wants to compete for a championship. Unless something were to happen to LeBron James, Cleveland will be coming out of the East. Oklahoma City has a very competitive team, but I'm still not sure they can beat Golden State. I'd love to see that though! Carmelo Anthony is highly underrated, with Phil Jackson having made things worse.

The other thing to consider is none of these teams have much to offer in terms of money. Miami is the only team that's got some cap space to make a higher offer to Wade. I don't see him going back to Miami right now though. I'm going to say Wade will sign with Cleveland. 

Let's see what happens.
