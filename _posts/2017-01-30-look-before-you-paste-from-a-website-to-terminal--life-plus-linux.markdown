Found this great tip [via Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/links/11785). Basically, if you're on a site you don't trust, don't just copy paste into your terminal. In fact, as Jeremy points out:

> This cautionary tale backs up a small tip I heard for getting to understand how found code works: deliberately type it out instead of copying and pasting.

Glad I came across this *before* having my computer hijacked.
