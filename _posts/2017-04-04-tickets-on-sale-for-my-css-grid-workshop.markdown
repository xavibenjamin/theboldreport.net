You may have noticed that [I’m obsessed with CSS Grid](https://theboldreport.net/topics/#grid-layout). I’ve been making all types of things with it and loving it. When you see the new things possible for us with this new spec, I think you’ll be just as excited.

A few weeks ago, I gave a talk at a local conference here in the Twin Cities and wanted to expand that into a two hour workshop. My idea is simple: help people learn CSS Grid, but sell tickets at an affordable price. Workshops at conferences can cost up to $400 and I’ve never been able to go to one because of it.

So come to my workshop. Early Bird tickets are priced at $49 until this Friday which will give you access to the live online workshop and the video so that you can go back and rewatch. After April 7<sup>th</sup>, tickets will go up to $99.

The two hour workshop will talk about some of the issues we've had with layout and you’ll code along with me as we solve these problems with CSS Grid. Even if you can’t watch the workshop live, you’ll still get access to videos and code.

I wanted to do something nice for people who support my projects. People like you that read this site. So if you’re going to buy, please use the code `timismyfriend` and you’ll get 50% off.

And can I ask a favor? Even if this isn’t for you, please share it on social media so that others can find it. I’d greatly appreciate that!
