Justin Jackson:

> The general consensus right now is that if your show doesn’t have 30,000 – 50,000 downloads per month, you can’t get any sponsor to look at you seriously. To really get the big advertisers (MailChimp, Squarespace) you need 50,000 downloads per episode.

Let’s be honest here. Your podcast probably doesn’t have 30k to 50k listeners. Don’t feel bad about that, none of my podcasts ever reached those numbers and I still made some nice side income from them. Justin here has some great ideas on how you can do it too. The crux of the matter here isn’t really the size of your audience, it’s how engaged they are with you.
