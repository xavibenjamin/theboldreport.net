Chris Bowler:

> I realize many folks consider talking about your blogging toolset is akin to talking about your relationship issues in public. Loudly. But I appreciate hearing how the writers I respect get content on their site and hopefully someone can benefit from hearing about my own.

I’m so glad Chris decided to ignore the haters of process. I love hearing how people work towards being more efficient, and Chris has a setup, that although simple, is powerful in making it easier for him to write. I plan to implement parts of it in my own process. Thanks, Chris.
