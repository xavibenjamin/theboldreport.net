>BlackBerry has officially filed a letter with Canadian holding company Fairfax Financial, an offer that could lead to it returning to private ownership.

This could be a good thing for them. I remember when BlackBerry was on top, and then fell to the pits of irrelevance. Personally, I hope this helps them get their act together. I believe that the smartphone market will only continue to get better with better competition.
