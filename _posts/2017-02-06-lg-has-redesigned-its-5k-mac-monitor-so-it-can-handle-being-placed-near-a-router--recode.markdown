As it is, [the options in the display space are pretty slim](https://theboldreport.net/2017/01/displays-for-designers-and-developers-bjango/), but now this? How embarrassing. With the experience LG has making monitors, it feels downright stupid. I hope this ordeal gets Apple to rethink it's departure from the display business.
