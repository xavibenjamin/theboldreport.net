My friend and ex-boss, Matthew Eppelsheimer, wasn’t happy with all the similarities in The Force Awakens. After viewing number three, he had this to say:

> After my third viewing, I started to realize that all of those familiar elements distract from what are in fact many fresh and original ideas that we’ve never seen before in a Star Wars film.
> 
> The idea that Episode VII is just a rehashing of the first three Star Wars films falls apart on close inspection.

Matthew goes on to write an awesome list of things we’ve never seen in a Star Wars film. If you were bothered by the parallels, this will open your eyes to all new stuff you missed.
