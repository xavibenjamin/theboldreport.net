Greetings, you fine-looking people!

This week was a busy one with a lot of news. I didn't have enough time to write about each of them so I'm putting them all together in one post á la [Katie Floyd](https://katiefloyd.com/). Here are the stories that were interesting to me this week:

- **[Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) by Susan Fowler**  
This one happened while I was out with a cold. What a massive mess. Uber, time and time again, proves that their culture is toxic in all new levels. HR is shown to be useless, and I find it baffling that anyone would think they could get away with this. I've deleted my Uber account and their app from my phone, and I'd advise you to do the same. Their complicity in this sexual harassment cannot be tolerated.

- [Firefox 52](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/52) and [Chrome 57](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/nic57) landed in the same week, and with it, CSS Grid support in both of them. CSS Grid is no longer behind a flag in two major browsers, and you should be learning it. [Jen Simmons' article](http://jensimmons.com/post/feb-27-2017/learn-css-grid) will point you in the right direction. [Micah Godbolt's post](https://micahgodbolt.com/blog/css-grid-fist-look/) is great too. [I also recorded a video](https://youtu.be/HmIpJDfcZrA) on making a portfolio layout with CSS Grid. I'm excited to see all the new things we'll do.

- **[No-Pressure Blogging](http://www.manton.org/2017/03/no-pressure-blogging.html) by Manton Reece**  
This sentiment from Manton spoke to me. I struggle with the feeling that my words or ideas aren't good enough to write. But the truth is, not every post is going to be revolutionary. Honestly, I still haven't published mine. Who knows if I ever will. That's ok. It's a blog post and as long as I've documented something for myself and helped a person or two, I'm ok with that.

- **[Why I Left Mac for Windows: Apple Has Given Up](http://char.gd/microsoft/why-i-left-mac-for-windows/) by Owen Williams**  
I hadn't noticed how much Apple has ignored the Mac. Some of the features that I love about the Mac and have made it great for me were introduced back in 2012. It's sad. I'm not about to switch to Windows, but if nothing changes, the switch may be inevitable.

- **[Just Another HTTPS Nudge](https://css-tricks.com/just-another-https-nudge/) on CSS Tricks**  
Chris Coyier outlines a scary scenario that drills home the point on HTTPS. We should all be using it. While [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) has made the process easier, enabling HTTPS and renewing certificates is not as pain-free as it should be.

- **[The Trouble With Cross Posting](https://jonathanhays.me/2016/04/12/the-trouble-with-cross-posting/) by Jonathan Hays**  
I've been doing a lot of research into microblogging these days and one of the biggest frustrations is not being able to cross post effectively. I'm looking forward to seeing [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog/) fix this.

Hope you had an excellent week, and have a restful weekend.
