Greg Sandoval reporting for *GeekWire*:

> T-Mobile, one of the country’s largest providers of mobile internet access, launched Binge On in November. The service features video from Netflix, Amazon, HBO and others. Binge On customers can watch this content without it counting against their data allotments.

I'm surprised this didn't come up sooner. Not as direct as throttling a site, like Comcast tried to do with Netflix, but instead giving you these select sites essentially for free. Supposedly it's a program you can opt-out of, but the average user won't do it. In fact, they might not even understand what's so wrong about it. People will choose to watch something on these platforms instead of others, giving T-Mobile control it shouldn't have.
