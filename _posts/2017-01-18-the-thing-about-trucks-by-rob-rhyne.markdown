Rob Rhyne explains why he'd take his Mac if he could only take one device with him:

> My thinking goes like this: I can borrow someone else’s phone if I need to make a call, but I want *my* Mac if I need to do any sort of deep thinking. This feeling of personalization runs deep in a desktop operating system. It’s much more than wallpaper, or color schemes. My Mac is loaded with software and utilities that *I have written* custom for my specific use. I’m not talking about general software development, but scripting, and automation which ease my everyday tasks.

Rob nails it by saying that the iPad-only community seems to be filled with dogma. I personally find myself in a middle ground. I do a lot with iOS—[I publish most articles on this site with iOS](/2016/01/publishing-to-jekyll-from-ios/), in fact—but there are things that I like doing on my Mac. Things I can't do on iOS by design. As with most situations, do what works best for you.
