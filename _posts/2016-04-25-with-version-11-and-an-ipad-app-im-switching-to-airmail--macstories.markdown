Federico Viticci on *MacStories*:

> I've switched to Airmail as my full-time email app on the iPhone and iPad. While Airmail doesn't necessarily reinvent email as we know it, Bloop has built a solid email client for users who are looking for serious email management functionalities on iOS. If you didn't pay attention to Airmail when it launched on the iPhone, now's a good time to have another look.

Airmail keeps getting better, but I just can’t seem to stick with it. These days I’m using Nylas N1 on the Mac and Outlook for iOS (😱). Still, a great read, and Airmail might be the solution for you.
