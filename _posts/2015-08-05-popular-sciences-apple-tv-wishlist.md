Dave Gershgorn writing for *Popular Science*:

> Early reports say that Apple is going to be including a Touch ID sensor in the new Apple TV remote. This could be an immediate home run, if it’s implemented correctly. If each user was able to make their own profile and home screen, unlocked based on their fingerprint, families wouldn’t have to worry about parental lock passcodes and roommates could each have their own unique account. Even better if you can add another Apple ID to a separate profile.

An interesting list of wishes for the new Apple TV. My hope is that rumors about the SDK are true. With an SDK, the possibilities are endless—we’ll see more channels pop up from everywhere—and hopefully games. I’ve always wondered why the Apple TV isn’t game console too, which to me is a such a no-brainer.
