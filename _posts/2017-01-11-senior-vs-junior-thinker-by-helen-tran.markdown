Helen Tran on how Senior Designers identify a problem differently from Junior Designers:

> When being described a problem, a Senior Designer will likely ask more questions than their Junior counterpart. This is to ensure that the person describing the problem is clear about the problem to begin with. Sometimes what’s being described is a *symptom* of a problem.
>
> There’s the root cause (the system’s problem) and then there are the *system antics* or the *unexpected results* of the system. These *antics* are what people tend to mistake for the actual problem itself.

Insightful post. An article like this always helps you see where you're doing a better job than when you started, and where you still have to improve.
