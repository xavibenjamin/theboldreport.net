Marco Arment on the iPhone X's "notch":

> Many app developers are planning to hide the notch in the UI with black bars. But Apple explicitly [says not to](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/iphone-x/).

> Apple just completely changed the fundamental shape of the most important, most successful, and most recognizable tech product that the world has ever seen.

> *That’s* courage.


I see Marco's point on Apple not going with the generic phone shape. The iPhone shape is unique and you didn't want to lose that in its next iteration. Calling this notch "courage" however, is more than a stretch. It's calling an undeniable misstep in design on Apple's part, innovation. Defending Apple's decision here is foolish and puts Marco's taste in question.
