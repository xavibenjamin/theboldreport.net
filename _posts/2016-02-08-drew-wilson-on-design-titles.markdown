Drew Wilson: 

> Currently in the software industry any title that has "Design" somewhere in it refers to someone that arranges pixels on a screen. I propose that any title with "Design" in it should be applicable to anyone working on any aspect of software.

He's got a good point. But regarding the central theme of his post, I wonder if it actually matters. Does it matter what we call ourselves? To me, the more important question is: who are the titles for? For us, or for other people? If I told someone I met at a friend's barbecue that I was a "Visual Designer," they'd have no idea what the hell that is.

All that being said, I know titles have their importance, and the post reminds me not to fall into the trap of title inflation. At the end of the day, I just make websites. That's it.
