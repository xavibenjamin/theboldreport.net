subtitle: The third anniversary is upon us. Here's an update on what's been happening with the site, what's coming, and a special giveaway for readers.
---
I published [the first post](https://theboldreport.net/2013/09/welcome/) on *The Bold Report* on September 23, 2013. It was an introduction to this new site, and a migration from the personal site where I’d been writing for about five years. As usual, [I got a little overly sentimental](https://ttimsmith.com/2013/09/moving-to-the-bold-report).

*The Bold Report* was created as a new Jekyll site—I was done using WordPress to blog. This is what it looked like when I started writing:

## Personal Growth

When I started this site, I wanted to be the next John Gruber. Since then, I’ve come to the conclusion that there is only one Gruber and any attempt to imitate him is futile. Plus, I don’t actually want to write this site for a living; I love to discuss a wide range of things and this is my safe place to do that.

Since day one, *The Bold Report* has come a long way. My writing has improved by leaps and bounds. I’ve distanced myself from the tech pundit I was trying to be at the beginning. Instead I’m just me. In my defense, I was 21 when I started writing here. I've grown a lot in three years. Through the School of Hard Knocks, I arrived at who I am and what I stand for. Many of my early stupid opinions were insecurity. Now if I have stupid opinions, it's because I'm being stupid. Or you’re wrong. Probably the latter 😜.

## Development

The way I design and develop this site has also changed drastically. In the beginning I wasn’t concerned with how I was going about making changes. I would commit directly to the `master` branch and my commit messages were all over the place. Therefore I felt *The Bold Report* wasn’t a great showcase of my development skills. I excused this by saying it was “my playground”, but in the end I didn’t really understand much of the codebase. And I had written it all! That’s not good.

With the `v4.0.0` release of this site, I had to make a change. I trashed most of the CSS I’d written and started from scratch. I was pretty happy with myself. Looking at some of it now makes me want to barf. But I’ll get to it for the `v5.0.0`. Since about a month ago, I’ve been treating this project more like software. Because really, it kind of is. The site is a product.

So I’ve been using normal git flow by creating branches, then merging via pull requests. Every third or fourth pull request is then drafted into a release. [Here’s what a recent release looks like](https://github.com/smithtimmytim/theboldreport.net/releases/tag/v4.8.3). More than anything, it’s a great way for me to keep track of what’s happening. But if this is your type of thing, feel free to follow along.

## Contributions

September saw the first ever contributions to the site by someone other than me! TJ Draper wrote about [Apple removing ports from the MacBook Pro]({% post_url 2016-09-15-apple-removing-ports-from-macbook-pro %}) and Keaton Taylor wrote about [new `<video>` capabilities in iOS 10]({% post_url 2016-09-20-iOS10-expands-autoplay-for-mobile %}). These are exactly the type of contributions I was looking for. I wanted posts that were important and affected the individual writer. This blog is about personal interest, and that creates a path for a beautifully eclectic collection of topics.

How contributions from other writers shape the site will be interesting to watch. If that worries you at all, I assure you that I’m still *very* interested in writing here and I have the final say on whatever gets published. If you’re interested in writing on *The Bold Report*, email me at [tim@theboldreport.net](mailto:tim@theboldreport.net).

## What's Been Published

In three years, I’ve published some pieces that I’m really proud of:

- [Review: 1Password 4 for Mac]({% post_url 2013-10-03-review-1password-4-for-mac %}) – This is my first thought-out review. I *love* 1Password, so when they asked if anyone wanted to test their then-newest version, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity.
- [Review: Human Solution Uplift Desk]({% post_url 2016-04-28-review-human-solution-uplift-desk %}) – I wrote an extensive review of my beloved standing desk. 90% of this post was written on iOS and I published it from iOS.
- [My Brief Review Series](/topics/#brief-review) – My new “Brief Review” series has been very fun to write and lacks the pressure of writing a lengthy review. Some things just don’t need a thousand-word essay; the point is to tell you whether I like the product or not and give you a concise reason why.
- [The Web is Back!]({% post_url 2016-03-16-the-web-is-back %}) – After going to the Future of Web Design conference in New York, I was ecstatic about some of the progress we’ve made in terms of layout on the web. There’s still much work to be done, but it’s a space to watch. Creating the layout and design for the post was a lot of fun too.
- [Burnout. That Word Doesn’t Mean What You Think it Means]({% post_url 2016-09-07-burnout-that-word-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means %}) – One of my more recent posts where I had the chance to be totally honest about some of my mistakes.
- The [two posts]({% post_url 2015-07-31-redirects-on-heroku-with-rack-rewrite %}) I wrote about hosting [Jekyll on Heroku]({% post_url 2015-06-29-hosting-a-jekyll-site-on-heroku %}) were a pleasure to write and boy did I learn a lot. Figuring out how to do this wasn’t easy, but once it was done, I was so glad I switched.

In three years, I’ve written more than 300 posts, so this is a very short list of my favorites. Really, they’re all my favorites. I wouldn’t have published any of my pieces if I wasn’t proud of them.

## Now for Some Stats!

[I did this about a month after launching the site]({% post_url 2013-10-23-our-first-month %}), and it’s time for an update. Unfortunately, I stopped using Google Analytics for a while and just started using it again, so some of their stats only cover the past few weeks. I figured I’d share the numbers that most people want to know: subscribers.

- 43 people subscribe to the [master feed](/atom.xml)
- 26 people subscribe to the [articles-only feed](/atom.articles.xml)
- 52 people follow [*The Bold Report* on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theboldreport)
- 86.21% visit from Google Chrome
- 6.90% visit with Safari (that’s surprising; I would have guessed more)

Unfortunately, we had more Twitter followers a month after the site launched than right now. The site’s readership hasn’t grown as much as I’d like. Which brings me to our next section!

## Subscription Drive

This anniversary, I’m trying something new. In an effort to get more people subscribed and reading the site, I’ve decided to run a subscription drive. Basically, a whole week where I’ll be reminding people to subscribe, and giving away some awesome stuff at the end. Tell ‘em what they’ll win, Johnny!

## The Giveaway

It’s a brand new car! Actually… no, it’s not, but I’ve grouped the excellent swag that I *am* giving away into three boxes:

### Coffee Box

This box comes complete with an [AeroPress](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/) sent to your home, a [three-month Craft Coffee subscription](https://www.craftcoffee.com/), and a [copy of *Jolt* by Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/jolt/). Basically, once you’re nice and caffeinated, you can apply the awesome tips you read in *Jolt*.

### Creative Box

This gift comes with a copy of [Issue 3 of *The Great Discontent*](https://shop.thegreatdiscontent.com/collections/issues/products/the-great-discontent-issue-three), a copy of [*Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles* by Ethan Marcotte](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles), and a [Moleskine Grid Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Classic-Notebook-Squared-Notebooks/dp/8883701135/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474648471&sr=8-1&keywords=moleskine+grid+notebook). This box will inspire you, teach you new things, and then help you get your ideas down on paper.

### Spider-Man Box

This box will feed your inner (and outer?) nerdiness. It comes with a bobble-head Funko Pop! Spider-Man, a soft sculpture Spider-Man, and a Spider-Man patch; all exclusives from Marvel Collector Corps. Who doesn’t love Spider-Man?
