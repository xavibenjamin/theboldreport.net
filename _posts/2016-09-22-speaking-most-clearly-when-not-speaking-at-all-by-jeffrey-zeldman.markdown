Jeffrey Zeldman:

> Writing brain and speaking brain verbalize differently for me, I have found. I’m considered a passable conference speaker, and, from friendly conversations to client meetings, I’m rarely at a loss for words. But the ideas I’m able to articulate with my mouth are nothing, absolutely nothing, to those I can sometimes share while writing.

> In writing I have clarity of vision and authority of tone that I almost completely lack when speaking with more than one person at a time.

I find this so interesting in that it’s very different from the way I feel. While Jeffrey finds comfort in writing, writing is where I struggle the most. I know who I am when I speak and how to say what I feel, but my writing rarely feels like me.
