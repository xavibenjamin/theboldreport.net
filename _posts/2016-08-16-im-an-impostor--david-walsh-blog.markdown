> If you're reading this post, you probably aren't an impostor, because...

> - You believe you might be an impostor — those who think they're experts are anything but, those who know they aren't experts know how much they *don’t* know
> - You read blogs — you get new opinions and see new techniques
> - You get work — whether it's a big company job or enough to pay the bills, you can make money punching keys on a computer (have you *seen* people who aren't tech savvy try to do anything on a computer?)
> - You know what responsive design is, and why it's important

This article came to me at a perfect time. I don't really know how I found it, but last week was difficult. I felt useless and like a fraud. This post instead helped me concentrate on all the great things I do, how valuable I am as a designer and developer, and that even if all that wasn't true, I have an amazing wife and family who love me deeply. Maybe you're in need of the same reminder?
