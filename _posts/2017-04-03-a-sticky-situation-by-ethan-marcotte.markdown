Ethan Marcotte:

> Last week, I thought I’d clean up my blog entries a bit. (Yep. I’m that fun.) Before, there were a couple short but dense paragraphs, each containing a truckload of links: one linking to my archives, a couple links to read either the previous and next posts, and then a few trillion links to “share” the “entry” on “social media” “web-sites.” Now, that’s all been reduced to two links, one for the preceding entry, and one for the next one.

Ethan describes a bug he found with `position: sticky` and how it "magically" disappeared. I love writeups like this. More people (myself included) should do it.
