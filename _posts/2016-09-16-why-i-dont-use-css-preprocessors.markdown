Roger Johansson:

> Whenever I mention that I don’t use CSS preprocessors I tend to get strange looks from people who cannot imagine writing CSS without Sass. And so I have to defend my choice and explain why, over and over. Some people will understand, most won’t. Or they don’t want to. But here’s an attempt to explain my reasoning.

Roger makes a mostly compelling argument even though he has moments where his reasons fall flat. What makes me the most happy is that his article isn’t filled with dogma, it’s more a this-works-for-me type piece. As long as you know how to write CSS, it shouldn’t matter what you use to write it.
