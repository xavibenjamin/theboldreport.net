Shaun Powell writing for NBA.com:

> [Kobe Bryant](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kobe_bryant/?iref:nba:story_page:playerfile) is now 37 and [ready for retirement](http://www.nba.com/kobe), and plenty has been said about Kobe in the two decades in between. He even summed up his profile in a pre-packaged, marketable two-word assessment: "Hero/Villain." Feel free to choose your side, or accept both. What is undeniable, though, is how he elevated himself a notch above the many great players in this aspect: Only a select handful managed to cast a spell over an entire generation.

I won't miss the arrogance and selfishness. I will miss those moments where he did the impossible, close a game like no one else could. An era in basketball has ended.
