Fran Blinebury reporting for NBA.com:

>After another listless, desultory effort in a loss at Portland that sent them staggering into the All-Star break with a record below .500 and out of the Western Conference playoff seedings, interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said his team was "broken."
>
>So the response might be to break the Rockets up completely.

>Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports is reporting that general manager Daryl Morey is reaching out around the league about trading center Dwight Howard.

Here's a story I saw back in Mexico, and couldn't write about it. The trade deadline came and went; no deal. And I mean, c'mon, who would take it? Howard had made it clear that he was going to opt out of the final year of his contract. No team was going to send some quality players and maybe some picks for a few months with him.

Come June, Dwight will leave yet another team, only solidifying the fact that *he is* the problem. With age, injuries, and a skill set that leaves a lot to be desired, we'll see what city will get to complain about him next.
