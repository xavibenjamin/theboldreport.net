>Save your money. A small business/freelancer needs cash. Keep at least three months of overhead sitting in a savings account. Then personally you need at least two months of living costs in a savings account.

What an honest post. I'm historically horrible at saving money, and yet as a freelancer, I know I should have at least 5 months of savings. I don't think I've ever had that saved in my life, even when I was making good money.

Save your money peeps!
