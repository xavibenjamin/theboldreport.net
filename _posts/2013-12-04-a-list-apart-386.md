In ["Surveying the Big Screen"](http://alistapart.com/article/surveying-the-big-screen), Mike Pick does a great job of pointing out the need to explore the possibilities on larger screens.[^1] Alex Feyerke writes an excellent article titled ["Designing Offline-First Web Apps"](http://alistapart.com/article/offline-first), and talks about a fact of life—being offline. How does that affect the way we design and build applications?
