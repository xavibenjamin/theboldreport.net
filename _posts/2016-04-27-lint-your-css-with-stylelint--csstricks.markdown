And later on you or some other sorry sap will face the consequences of those mistakes that slipped into your CSS.

I'm testing stylelint at work, trying to figure out if it'll work for us. I can attest to the fact that it's extendable, and completely flexible; adapting to the style you want. Another benefit clearly being that it isn't Sass-specific which scss-lint is. So if you're using regular ole CSS (Why? Just kidding, no judgement here), this is definitely for you. Of course, stylelint supports other syntaxes, and easily integrates into your project as an NPM package.
