From NBA.com:

> Chicago Bulls center Pau Gasol has been named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to replace his teammate, injured Eastern Conference All-Star reserve Jimmy Butler (strained left knee), in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 14 at Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

The fact that Pau Gasol is averaging a double-double at the age of 35 and wasn't selected as a starter, is absolutely ridiculous. He's one of my favorite players of all time. I think my fellow Laker fans don't appreciate what he did for the back-to-back championships enough. Pau is a future hall-of-famer, and yet one of the most underrated players in the league.
