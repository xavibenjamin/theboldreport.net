> While Medium is certainly doing a lot right, and I still think [it’s not a bad place to mirror content](http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html), the “long run” Glenn mentions is really what we should think about when considering Medium. I have no confidence that Medium will last 5-10 years.
