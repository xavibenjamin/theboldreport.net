Howard Beck writing for the *Bleacher Report*:

> Howard—an eight-time All-Star and three-time Defensive Player of the Year—is about to enter free agency and based on his resume should be one of the most coveted players on the market, right after Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant.

> He won't be.
 
 Would I pay Dwight Howard $31 Million? In short, hell no. The fact that he thinks he's worth it is so comical it's almost sad. But hey, he's not completely useless, he's worth money and the contract he got from Atlanta proves that. I may not like him, but he *could* be a great player. 

The problem is and has been if he wants to be. Unfortunately, as the article so well points out, Dwight wants to play a style of basketball that just doesn't make sense anymore. A huge shame considering how effective he could be if he'd take a smart person's advice (none of which he has yet seemed to be getting).
 
 In the end, do I like the guy? No. He's a quitter. But I hope—for his own damn sake—that changes with his new home.
