Even as a huge Laker fan, I don't see the logic behind this decision. Kobe Bryant has been one of the best players of the current era, but I certainly thought this would be his last year. As great as he is, age eventually catches up with you.

***But*** I could be terribly wrong. They don't call him the Black Mamba for nothing.
