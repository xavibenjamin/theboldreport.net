>Once I discovered the best times I like to work as a freelancer, I realized, why would I want to be working past that anyways? I love my job but I also love doing things outside my job. These things bring me great happiness and satisfaction, in turn, giving me the motivation and passion needed to perform effectively at my job.

I love when people write about how working long hours is not a good idea. I love it when someone like Janna Hagan—whom I admire very much—does it.

Speaking of which, have a great weekend!
