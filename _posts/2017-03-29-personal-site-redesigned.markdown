Three months ago, I set out to redesign my personal site. I usually start feeling the itch every year or so. I don't really know what version this is, but [feel free to look at previous iterations on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ttimsmith.com). 

This year, I'd learned a lot about CSS Grid, and I was determined to ship my new site using it. Little did I know how much support it'd have by now. As of this writing, [Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, and Chrome on Android all support CSS Grid](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). That's pretty amazing considering that when I started working on this refresh, I was using Firefox Nightly to make sure Grid was working.

In addition, to the Grid stuff, I've tried to add more of my personality to the site, and communicate who I am and what I'm good at. Also, the thing is speedy. With the cache disabled, it's loading in 815ms. With the cache enabled, it's fully loaded in 353ms. Even on Good 3G, the DOM is loaded in 657ms, with full page load coming in 3.68s. Obviously, there are always improvements to be made, but I'm really happy.

Another thing I focused on was to optimize space on large screens. I still think there's work to do in this department, but it's definitely better than previous versions. You'll see that blog posts go from one column to two then three. I'm still containing content at a certain width, which some might disagree with but I like it.

I invite you to take a look, use your inspector tool (or [look at the code on GitHub](https://github.com/smithtimmytim/ttimsmith.com)), and let me know what you think. If you have some constructive criticism [send me an email](tim@theboldreport.net). I'd love to hear from you.
