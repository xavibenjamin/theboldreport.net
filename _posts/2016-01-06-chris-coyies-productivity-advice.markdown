Chris Coyier: 

> "How do they do it all?" people unceasingly want to know. The answer is never satisfying. Nobody actually has any magic tricks. Nobody slows down time. They do work and work gets done, whether it's marinating alligator heads or building websites. You'll be surprised how much you will do in a day if you sit and do it.

So true. Just reminds me that when I haven't been able to do something, it's because *I* haven't made it a priority. That truth can be very empowering.
