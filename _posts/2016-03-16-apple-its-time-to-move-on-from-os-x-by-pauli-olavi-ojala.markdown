> … a whole generation of users have come to the Mac platform with no previous contact to Mac OS versions 1 through 9, and no idea that “X” means something else than what it looks like. Its pronounciation has become a kind of secret handshake: if you’re a “real” Mac user, you say “ten”.

It isn't the first time this is suggested. I've read about it on at least [two](http://www.macworld.com/article/2922517/the-end-of-os-x-a-modest-proposal.html) [occasions](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/9/os-x-el-capitan-review), and every time it makes more sense. The current name alienates new people to the platform. I bought my first Mac in 2007, and remember the moment I was corrected, "it's pronounced *OS ten*." 

Apple needs to drop the X. Rename the Mac's OS whether that means following the pattern of its other operating systems, or finding another new-user-friendly alternative.
