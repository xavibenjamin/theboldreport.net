Matt Gemmell:

> This entire site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. I have custom templates, CSS, and even several Ruby plugins, and I’m pretty pleased with it. It lets me keep all my content in [Markdown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and edit posts in any text editor.

> My host is [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=e453158f782bced09ea8c27a023fe84eb032bd2b) (oh how I love them), and I have a fully iPad-only workflow for blogging and updating the site.

I love these types of posts. We should all be sharing how we do stuff with our own setup. I wrote about [my own method of publishing to Jekyll via iOS](/2016/01/publishing-to-jekyll-from-ios/), and while drastically different to Matt's method, it's documented and potentially helpful to many people. If you're interested in going *#iPadOnly*, I definitely recommend [Matt's series on the topic](http://mattgemmell.com/category/ipad-only/).
