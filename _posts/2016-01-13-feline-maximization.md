> Here’s an interesting tale of copyright gone weird from [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/the-big-bang-theory-sued-for-using-soft-kitty-lyrics-in-hit-tv-show/). The interminable CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory is being sued for copyright infringement of a children’s poem called “Soft Kitty”.

Here’s a fascinating article about a copyright lawsuit that makes no sense. I mean, United States copyright law is already extremely confusing, but this whole fiasco is quite complicated. Fortunately, you might leave the article having a better grasp on the topic.
