Timothy Burke on *Screengrabber*:

> Microsoft has been on a season-long campaign to make sure you know the tablet computers on NFL sidelines are their Surface models, **not** iPads. Like most Microsoft products, the Surface tablets are crashing—at least those on the New England sideline.

Hahahahaha! But wait! It gets better!

> **Update (5:55 p.m):** Microsoft has issued a statement denying responsibility for the tablets’ failures.

Real shocker.
