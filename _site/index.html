        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>We all have our moments when we feel down. In my case, the past two years have been full of personal mistakes and bad decisions. Failure is difficult to accept. Yet, these things considered, it’s not the end; the book has not yet been finished, even when at times, it certainly feels like it.</p>

<p>Although, anyone would’ve considered me an optimist a year ago, it’s not so easy in practice. Yet, something I’ve forced myself to do, is always remember I have reasons to be grateful. I think it’s a good idea to do this whether you’re going through a tough time or not.</p>

<p>I live in a very privileged part of the world, and I often get wrapped up in my own problems, client frustrations, and whining about stupidities, that I forget how much worse it could really be. My alarm in the morning could be a bomb, instead of my cute cat, and I could be in a perpetual state of worry. There are people going through much worse than I’ve <em>ever</em> gone through, and that empathy allows me to step back and look at my life objectively.</p>

<p>My life isn’t perfect. I don’t make nearly as much money as I’d like, I’ve been a disappointment to people who care about me, I have debt that is far away from being paid off, I’m overweight, and I’ve hurt a girl I was in love with, twice… twice.</p>

<p>Yet, I have parents, family and friends that love me, and add meaning to my life. I’m healthy. I haven’t gone hungry. I work in an amazing industry, where I can say I love my job. And I live in a beautiful place that enjoys the four amazing seasons.</p>

<p>Happiness and contentment are a choice, and I <em>choose</em> to be happy, I <em>choose</em> to be grateful for what I have, I <em>choose</em> to make lemonade out of lemons.</p>

<p>Should I pour you a glass?</p>

        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>My friend, <a href="http://adamstacoviak.com/">Adam Stacoviak</a>, pointed me to a tool called <a href="https://getportly.com/">Portly</a>. Portly allows you to display your local web server, publicly. </p>

<p>If you look at the Portly site, you can tell that the applications of this menubar app, are many. I’ve been using it to do local device testing without the need for a staging server. This a very basic usage of this powerful app, but it’s been a huge timesaver for me.</p>

<p>I <em>always</em> develop sites locally.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> One problem I constantly ran into, is that I wasn’t able to easily test sites on my different devices. Sure, you can use a bookmarklet, resize your browser, or sign up for something like BrowserStack, but I like to test from the comfort of my couch.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2013/10/portly-screenshot.png" alt="Portly Preferences" title="Portly Preferences" /></p>

<p>This is where Portly comes in. I simply add a tunnel in the app, point it to my local connection string,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> turn on the tunnel,  and go to the subdomain on my iPad or iPhone.</p>

<p>Now, I know there are other ways to do this, but I just wasn’t nerdy enough to implement them. Portly is easy, and <a href="https://getportly.com/plans">starting at $2.99/month</a>, a very good deal. You should definitely check it out. If you need help or have questions, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ttimsmith">Twitter</a> or <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#105;&#109;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#098;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">email me</a>.</p>

      <p>I’ve found that QA is much more enjoyable—and effective—when I’m relaxed and comfortable. I turn on the TV for background noise, sit back on the couch, and browse every single page of the site. I find things I need to fix and assign myself GitHub issues.

        <p>Chris Enns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The peo­ple who scoff at App​.net and won­der “why do we need another Twit­ter?” are missing the point. Actu­ally, they’re miss­ing the point of the inter­net. There’s plenty of room for another social net­work. You don’t have to use it but that doesn’t make it invalid. For every per­son that makes fun of Google+, there’s another 5 peo­ple get­ting a lot of com­mu­nity and fun out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, this article is talking about Favd, yet almost accidentally, he describes what I think is a very convincing argument for App.net’s relevance. Chris goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while Favd might look like “yet another Insta­gram clone”, it’s tak­ing the parts of Insta­gram that peo­ple enjoy — tak­ing and shar­ing pho­tos with friends online — and leav­ing behind the cor­po­rate shadi­ness that comes with being asso­ci­ated with Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris effectively points out, that just when we think a market has been saturated beyond belief, there’s always someone who can approach a problem a bit smarter.</p>

<p>I think this is pretty big news. A company’s brand is based a lot on public perception, and for Apple and Google to surpass Coca-Cola, which in my opinion is the one of the best brands ever created,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> is quite the compliment on how they’re doing.</p>

      <p>You know you agree with that. Whether you’re a Coke lover, or Pepsi lover (Oh god, can I footnote the footnote?), Coca-Cola has been advertising it’s drink with bears… bears.

<p>Google—in many ways—is the reason I do my job the way I do it. They’re advocates for building the web well, and fast. It’s hard for me to believe they’ll make a tool that does the opposite.</p>

        <h1><a href="/2013/09/document-everything">Document Everything</a></h1>
        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>Something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently is documentation. And yes, I’m thinking a little bit about legacy—documenting our life, and the things we make. However, I also mean documenting our process.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of mystery surrounding what we do. I remember being a newcomer and feeling overwhelmed by everything it seemed that I needed to learn. This is where I think documentation can help us a lot. </p>

<p>As an industry, we’re getting comfortable with doing things in the open. <a href="http://opensourcedesign.is/">Open Source Design</a> is trying to do this, a project which I happen to be a contributor on, and <a href="http://opensourcedesign.is/resourced/">there are other people doing it</a>.</p>

<p>But what about being open about what we charge for services? What about talking about how much designers should be making in a beginning job? Medium level? Senior level? Should we negotiate for a signing bonus? Do companies still do this? To be very honest, I only learned about some of these things a couple months ago when I had dinner with my friend <a href="http://bermonpainter.com/">Bermon</a>. Why is this such a mystery?</p>

<p>On a more personal level, what about our process? I have no documentation of my personal design and development process. All of it lives in my head, which quite frankly, isn’t useful for anyone. Pricing projects could be so much simpler if I had a process to run them through. </p>

<p>In a lot of ways, I don’t know what I’m doing. Yet, at the same time, I really do. But that knowledge is wasted if I don’t share it with others. Not to mention, there will always be people that can benefit from something I’ve learned. We’re all in different places of our career.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the past month, I’ve met so many smart people who are saying nothing. They have great ideas, but they don’t tell anyone about them. Then, there are others who are content with believing in mythical gatekeepers that prevent them from having a voice in this industry.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>It’s rubbish.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to have a voice, if you want to contribute, document everything. Tell people about what you’re doing, why you did it that way, and why others should think about doing it the same. We need your voice, but no one is going to beg you to use it.</p>

<p>As cliché as it might sound, anyone has the power to make our industry better, and personally that’s why I love our industry and working in the open. When many minds come together and collaborate and share, the end result is one-hundred times better. When more people share, we have a more diverse group of people to admire, to interview, to invite to speak, etc. </p>

<p>Step up. Document everything.</p>

        <p>Stephen Hackett on 512 Pixels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line is this: developers should be able to work on their product in a sustainable way. Realmac are some of the good guys, and to have to backtrack on a business decision is a damn shame, especially in a world where people pour money into IAP-based games day and night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a real problem. We can obviously see a huge hole in the App Store ecosystem. Honestly, I have no idea if Apple will ever implement upgrade pricing. <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-puts-its-price-tag-where-its-policy-charges-full-price-logic-pro-x-mac-app-store">Signs point to no</a>. </p>

<p>Apple desperately needs to examine this problem, and understand that the beautiful ecosystem it’s created, could crumble because of issues like this. And as the person purchasing software, I need to understand that developers <strong>are in their right</strong> to charge money for new software. I love what <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/382899550341853184">Marco Arment said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upset about <a href="https://twitter.com/realmacsoftware">@realmacsoftware</a> asking for another 3 dollars for a big update to Clear and going universal?</p>

  <p>You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

        <p>I had no idea that deployments could be this easy. Which surprises me, because I thought I had explored my deployment options. Kennedy was kind enough to make a video too.</p>

<p>Obviously this route is a bit nerdy, so if you want something that’s managed for you, I recommend <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a> or <a href="http://deployhq.com/">Deploy</a>.</p>

  <p>I’m adding some new stuff that I haven’t seen before in podcast players, and implementing what I think is the best set of core features from the existing apps. It’s my ideal podcast app.</p>

<p>This is why I love Marco Arment. It happens to be the reason he’s also very successful. He trusts his gut, which I think is one of the most difficult things to learn how to do. </p>

<p>Marco isn’t given enough credit as a designer. He may not create the visuals for all of his products, but he is very deliberate with his design decisions. Can’t wait for this app.</p>

  <p>At 1.4MB, today’s average page is 15 times larger than it was 10 years ago, primarily due to images (881kB) and script (224kB). Plain old HTML totals just 54kB—but when’s the last time you saw an HTML-only site? This average page also makes more than 100 HTTP requests. Whether they fetch a big object or a small one, these add up to more delay and more power wastage. The average site is also slow: Alexa’s top 2,000 retailer sites now take an average of more than seven seconds to load—much longer than users consider acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We published <a href="http://alistapart.com/issue/383">a great issue</a> today, but this particular article written by <a href="http://jcux.co.uk/">James Christie</a> caught my eye. I’ve been doing a lot of research into performance, but I’d stupidly never thought how slow sites can have an impact on our environment. Site performance matters; not only to visitors, but to our planet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This doesn’t surprise me at all. The level of care and detail Apple spends on this type of stuff is the reason people line up in the rain to get their devices. The article goes on to explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the iPhone 5 responded to touches at an average time of 55 milliseconds…. The closest Android device was the Samsung Galaxy S4 at 114 milliseconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s almost ridiculous to be examining this at the millisecond level, but tell me you’ve never noticed this delay when borrowing an Android device from a someone.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Those small details matter.</p>

<p>This is huge. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Netflix gets it. They’re making entertaining shows, and minimizing piracy. Traditional television hasn’t been able to nail both.</p>

<p>This could be a good thing for them. I remember when BlackBerry was on top, and then fell to the pits of irrelevance. Personally, I hope this helps them get their act together. I believe that the smartphone market will only continue to get better with better competition.</p>

        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>Welcome to <em>The Bold Report</em>!</p>

<p>I’ve been pondering the creation of a blog for quite some time now. In the past few months, I’ve felt that the goals I have for my writing have outgrown my personal site, and it was time to move it to its own home.</p>

<p><em>The Bold Report</em> is that new home. If you were a fan of my personal blog, you’ll see most of the same content on here. There will be long form articles which address topics that are on my mind, and links which point you to great content or exciting news around the web. As I have before, the links will have my commentary, which I’ve found that people appreciate.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site <em>is not</em> to report on breaking news—there are many other sites doing that—rather to inform you of exciting new technology, products you should keep your eye on, or what I happen to be learning at the moment.</p>

<p>We live in fascinating times. The evolution of technology is not only influencing how we design and develop experiences, it is changing the way we interact with others and our surroundings. Whole industries have been re-imagined, and that will only continue to happen. If nothing else, I want this blog to document that, and show my predictions as false or accurate.</p>

<p>It is my hope that you’ll join me on this journey. You can find the different ways to subscribe on the <a href="/subscribe/">subscribe page</a>. Although there are no comments on this site, please feel free to reach me <a href="https://twitter.com/ttimsmith">via Twitter</a> or email me at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#098;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#098;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, it means a lot to me.</p>

<p>—Tim</p>
