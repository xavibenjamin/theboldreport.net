          <blockquote>
  <p>This week, a Yale law professor took aim at Microsoft’s “<a href="http://www.bingiton.com/">Bing It On</a>” campaign…</p>

  <p>And <a href="http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayres/BingItOn_Draft%209.pdf">Ayres’ results differed sharply</a> from Microsoft’s: “We found that, to the contrary of Microsoft’s claim, 53 percent of subjects preferred Google and 41 percent Bing (6 percent of results were “ties”). This is not even close to the advertised claim that people prefer Bing ‘nearly two-to-one.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is fascinating. Microsoft responded to this professor, but in my opinion, gave a statement that were just words and didn’t explain why this test was so different from the one Microsoft conducted. </p>

<p>This is what happens when you make commercials that call out other brands. Making fun of other people is the low thing to do, and quite honestly, the easy thing to do. Tell us how Bing is <em>actually</em> better Microsoft, or shut up.</p>

          <p><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> is one of my favorite apps. The amount of time it has saved me is unmeasurable, and it’s made my password strategy secure and delightful.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know about 1Password, it’s a great utility app to store and generate passwords. For years, I was the person who had <em>the same password for everything</em>. With 1Password, I don’t do that anymore, I’m able to search through weak passwords and generate stronger ones, making it less likely to get hacked. Even if that does happen, none of my passwords are the same, so I only need to reset the one that’s been compromised.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The new interface is beautiful, and obviously influenced by the iOS version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chrome extension got a facelift, and generated passwords are not only filled in forms, they’re also copied to your clipboard.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1Password Mini brings most of the power of the main app to the menubar. This is great for entering passwords into apps that aren’t the browser. I disliked having to open the main app to do this in previous versions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-features-in-1password-4-for-mac">New Features in 1Password 4 for Mac</h2>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you open the new 1Password is the beautiful interface. If you’ve already purchased <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios">the latest iOS app</a>, you’ll notice that the new design is very similar, which delights me greatly. This redesign is years overdue, and the AgileBits team has delivered.</p>

<figure class="extendout"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-main.png" /><figcaption>1Password 4 for Mac Main View</figcaption></figure>

<p>I love that this redesign in a lot of ways is a re-align. The interface remains in the three column layout, yet with an easy-on-the-eyes, light background. The type has greatly improved, and the middle column no longer has the “shelf” look. The new layout, allows you to see more logins in the window without having to scroll and sports better looking icons. </p>

<p>Thankfully, the last column has been redone too. It used to be confusing to look at, and honestly, I didn’t know what was going on. It’s now a lot more simplified and only displays necessary information.</p>

<p>That being said, my favorite part of the main view, is the new “Security Audit” that appears in the far left column. It gives you easy access to weak passwords, duplicate passwords, and passwords that are old and might need to be changed. To be clear, this type of filtering has always been present in 1Password, but the fact that it’s now front and center, is very valuable to me.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-vaults">Multiple Vaults</h3>

<p>One feature that I can see becoming very popular is the new feature of multiple vaults. I haven’t actually been using this feature, but it’s one of those things that I think could help me organize the different sets of passwords. </p>

<p>This is especially true when I worked for a company. Having a separate vault exclusively for company logins, would’ve been a great way to get organized. This makes managing items easier, and makes cleaning out items you no longer need, a breeze.</p>

<figure class="alignright"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-create-new-vault.png" /><figcaption>With 1Password 4 you can now create new vaults. Organizing your passwords based on their use is simple.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="password-mini">1Password Mini</h3>
<p>I love that they made a menubar app. I’m definitely one of those people that has <em>way too many</em> of them.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Interestingly, the menubar app is what comes up now when you press <code>⌘CMD + \</code>. It seems that the 1Password browser extension is now only needed to run the code necessary for the autofill. You’ll never actually need to press the button anymore, which is nice, because it’s one less button in the extensions.</p>

<figure class="alignleft"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-1p-mini-item-details.png" /><figcaption>1Password Mini makes using 1Password easier and faster than ever.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s too early for me to say, but I think 1Password Mini could completely replace the main app for me. So far, I haven’t needed to open the main app for day-to-day responsibilities. To be honest, I only looked at the main app the day I downloaded it, and today when writing this review.</p>

<h2 id="other-features-you-should-know-about">Other Features You Should Know About</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shared Items</strong>   <br />
Till now, I haven’t needed to ever share login items, but I can definitely see the practicality of this. You can share items with email or iMessage, and if the person makes changes, the item automatically updates when shared back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>256-bit Authenticated Encryption</strong>   <br />
I have no idea what this means, except that 1Password is constantly being updated to be more and more secure. From what I’m told, this prevents attacks that don’t even exist yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wifi Sync</strong>   <br />
This feature is back from previous versions. Personally, I use Dropbox to sync my Vault between my Mac, iPad and iPhone, but whatever floats your boat. They have iCloud sync too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The AgileBits team have definitely outdone themselves. Not only is this update to 1Password beautiful, the new features and menubar app, make the upgrade very worth it.</p>

<p>If you’ve never used 1Password, this is a perfect time to purchase. In this day and age, it’s crucial to have secure passwords. This is an app you’ll later wonder how you did without.</p>

<p>It seems you can’t currently purchase the new 1Password from <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">the AgileBits store</a>, but that is where it’ll be very soon.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> You can also purchase from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id443987910?mt=12">the Mac App Store</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> You can now purchase and/or upgrade on <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">the AgileBits store</a>. Seems my speculation was wrong.</p>

      <p>This might seem like a small thing, but it’s one of my favorite additions to 1Password. I used to copy the password then press the fill button, and now those two actions are done with one press. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <p>We all have our moments when we feel down. In my case, the past two years have been full of personal mistakes and bad decisions. Failure is difficult to accept. Yet, these things considered, it’s not the end; the book has not yet been finished, even when at times, it certainly feels like it.</p>

<p>Although, anyone would’ve considered me an optimist a year ago, it’s not so easy in practice. Yet, something I’ve forced myself to do, is always remember I have reasons to be grateful. I think it’s a good idea to do this whether you’re going through a tough time or not.</p>

<p>I live in a very privileged part of the world, and I often get wrapped up in my own problems, client frustrations, and whining about stupidities, that I forget how much worse it could really be. My alarm in the morning could be a bomb, instead of my cute cat, and I could be in a perpetual state of worry. There are people going through much worse than I’ve <em>ever</em> gone through, and that empathy allows me to step back and look at my life objectively.</p>

<p>My life isn’t perfect. I don’t make nearly as much money as I’d like, I’ve been a disappointment to people who care about me, I have debt that is far away from being paid off, I’m overweight, and I’ve hurt a girl I was in love with, twice… twice.</p>

<p>Yet, I have parents, family and friends that love me, and add meaning to my life. I’m healthy. I haven’t gone hungry. I work in an amazing industry, where I can say I love my job. And I live in a beautiful place that enjoys the four amazing seasons.</p>

<p>Happiness and contentment are a choice, and I <em>choose</em> to be happy, I <em>choose</em> to be grateful for what I have, I <em>choose</em> to make lemonade out of lemons.</p>

<p>Should I pour you a glass?</p>

          <p>My friend, <a href="http://adamstacoviak.com/">Adam Stacoviak</a>, pointed me to a tool called <a href="https://getportly.com/">Portly</a>. Portly allows you to display your local web server, publicly. </p>

<p>If you look at the Portly site, you can tell that the applications of this menubar app, are many. I’ve been using it to do local device testing without the need for a staging server. This a very basic usage of this powerful app, but it’s been a huge timesaver for me.</p>

<p>I <em>always</em> develop sites locally.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> One problem I constantly ran into, is that I wasn’t able to easily test sites on my different devices. Sure, you can use a bookmarklet, resize your browser, or sign up for something like BrowserStack, but I like to test from the comfort of my couch.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2013/10/portly-screenshot.png" alt="Portly Preferences" title="Portly Preferences" /></p>

<p>This is where Portly comes in. I simply add a tunnel in the app, point it to my local connection string,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> turn on the tunnel,  and go to the subdomain on my iPad or iPhone.</p>

<p>Now, I know there are other ways to do this, but I just wasn’t nerdy enough to implement them. Portly is easy, and <a href="https://getportly.com/plans">starting at $2.99/month</a>, a very good deal. You should definitely check it out. If you need help or have questions, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ttimsmith">Twitter</a> or <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#105;&#109;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#098;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">email me</a>.</p>

          <p>Chris Enns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The peo­ple who scoff at App​.net and won­der “why do we need another Twit­ter?” are missing the point. Actu­ally, they’re miss­ing the point of the inter­net. There’s plenty of room for another social net­work. You don’t have to use it but that doesn’t make it invalid. For every per­son that makes fun of Google+, there’s another 5 peo­ple get­ting a lot of com­mu­nity and fun out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, this article is talking about Favd, yet almost accidentally, he describes what I think is a very convincing argument for App.net’s relevance. Chris goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while Favd might look like “yet another Insta­gram clone”, it’s tak­ing the parts of Insta­gram that peo­ple enjoy — tak­ing and shar­ing pho­tos with friends online — and leav­ing behind the cor­po­rate shadi­ness that comes with being asso­ci­ated with Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris effectively points out, that just when we think a market has been saturated beyond belief, there’s always someone who can approach a problem a bit smarter.</p>

<p>I think this is pretty big news.

          <p>Something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently is documentation. And yes, I’m thinking a little bit about legacy—documenting our life, and the things we make. However, I also mean documenting our process.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of mystery surrounding what we do. I remember being a newcomer and feeling overwhelmed by everything it seemed that I needed to learn. This is where I think documentation can help us a lot.</p>

<p>As an industry, we’re getting comfortable with doing things in the open. <a href="http://opensourcedesign.is/">Open Source Design</a> is trying to do this, a project which I happen to be a contributor on, and <a href="http://opensourcedesign.is/resourced/">there are other people doing it</a>.</p>

<p>But what about being open about what we charge for services? What about talking about how much designers should be making in a beginning job? Medium level? Senior level? Should we negotiate for a signing bonus? Do companies still do this? To be very honest, I only learned about some of these things a couple months ago when I had dinner with my friend <a href="http://bermonpainter.com/">Bermon</a>. Why is this such a mystery?</p>

<p>On a more personal level, what about our process? I have no documentation of my personal design and development process. All of it lives in my head, which quite frankly, isn’t useful for anyone. Pricing projects could be so much simpler if I had a process to run them through.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, I don’t know what I’m doing. Yet, at the same time, I really do. But that knowledge is wasted if I don’t share it with others. Not to mention, there will always be people that can benefit from something I’ve learned. We’re all in different places of our career.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the past month, I’ve met so many smart people who are saying nothing. They have great ideas, but they don’t tell anyone about them. Then, there are others who are content with believing in mythical gatekeepers that prevent them from having a voice in this industry.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>It’s rubbish.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to have a voice, if you want to contribute, document everything. Tell people about what you’re doing, why you did it that way, and why others should think about doing it the same. We need your voice, but no one is going to beg you to use it.</p>

<p>As cliché as it might sound, anyone has the power to make our industry better, and personally that’s why I love our industry and working in the open. When many minds come together and collaborate and share, the end result is one-hundred times better. When more people share, we have a more diverse group of people to admire, to interview, to invite to speak, etc.</p>

<p>Step up. Document everything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line is this: developers should be able to work on their product in a sustainable way. Realmac are some of the good guys, and to have to backtrack on a business decision is a damn shame, especially in a world where people pour money into IAP-based games day and night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a real problem. We can obviously see a huge hole in the App Store ecosystem. Honestly, I have no idea if Apple will ever implement upgrade pricing. <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-puts-its-price-tag-where-its-policy-charges-full-price-logic-pro-x-mac-app-store">Signs point to no</a>. </p>

<p>Apple desperately needs to examine this problem, and understand that the beautiful ecosystem it’s created, could crumble because of issues like this. And as the person purchasing software, I need to understand that developers <strong>are in their right</strong> to charge money for new software. I love what <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/382899550341853184">Marco Arment said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upset about <a href="https://twitter.com/realmacsoftware">@realmacsoftware</a> asking for another 3 dollars for a big update to Clear and going universal?</p>
